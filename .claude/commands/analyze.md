# Command: analyze

Deep analysis of a task or feature request before implementation. Researches how others solve similar problems, explores the codebase, identifies complications, and produces a comprehensive implementation plan.

**THIS IS A READ-ONLY COMMAND. NO FILES ARE CREATED OR MODIFIED.**

## Usage

```
/project:analyze [task description or feature request]
```

## Examples

```
/project:analyze "integrate payment processing system"
/project:analyze "add real-time notifications to chat"
/project:analyze "implement inventory forecasting with demand prediction"
```

# Analysis Request: $ARGUMENTS

## ⛔ CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS - READ THESE FIRST

**YOU ARE IN READ-ONLY ANALYSIS MODE.**

- ❌ DO NOT create any files
- ❌ DO NOT modify any files
- ❌ DO NOT write any code
- ❌ DO NOT run any commands that change state
- ❌ DO NOT fix, implement, or resolve anything
- ❌ DO NOT use Write, Edit, or file creation tools
- ✅ ONLY read, search, and analyze
- ✅ ONLY output your findings as text in this conversation

**If you feel the urge to fix something - STOP. Write it in the plan instead.**

Think hard about this analysis task. You are conducting pre-implementation research to help make informed decisions.

## Phase 1: Parallel Research (Use Subagents)

Launch these research tasks **in parallel** using the Task tool:

### 1.1 External Pattern Research (subagent_type: general-purpose)

Search for how others have implemented similar functionality:

- Search GitHub for repositories solving similar problems
- Search Stack Overflow for common patterns and pitfalls
- Look for official documentation or best practices guides
- Find blog posts or tutorials about this type of implementation
- Note any libraries, packages, or frameworks commonly used

Focus queries on: "$ARGUMENTS"

### 1.2 Codebase Exploration (subagent_type: Explore, thoroughness: very thorough)

Analyze the existing codebase:

- Search for related existing functionality using Grep and Glob
- Identify files and systems that will be affected
- Understand current patterns, conventions, and architecture
- Find similar implementations that could serve as templates
- Map dependencies and integration points

### 1.3 Slack & Discoveries Search

Search for institutional knowledge related to this task:

**Slack Messages** (use `mcp__task-manager__search_slack_messages`):

- Search for past discussions about this topic or similar features
- Look for context on why things were built a certain way
- Find any decisions or requirements discussed previously
- Identify stakeholders who have been involved in related work

**Discoveries** (use `mcp__task-manager__search_discoveries`):

- Search for any documented database insights related to this task
- Look for patterns, relationships, or gotchas previously captured
- Check for table-specific notes if database work is involved

Example queries based on task: "$ARGUMENTS"

### 1.4 Data Structure Analysis (if applicable)

If the task involves database operations:

- Use MCP database tools to LIST TABLES FIRST
- Then DESCRIBE relevant tables to understand schema
- Document field names, relationships, and constraints
- Identify any migration requirements
- **Check `mcp__task-manager__get_table_notes`** for any existing documentation on relevant tables

## Phase 2: Synthesis & Analysis

After gathering research, analyze findings:

### 2.1 Requirements Extraction

- Core objective and success criteria
- Scope boundaries (what's in vs out)
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- User-facing vs system-level changes

### 2.2 Implementation Assessment

Based on research, determine:

- Which existing patterns from the codebase to follow
- Which external patterns/approaches are most applicable
- New components, endpoints, or files required
- Database/schema changes needed
- Third-party dependencies to consider

### 2.3 Risk Identification

- Technical challenges and limitations
- Potential breaking changes
- Performance implications
- Security considerations
- Edge cases to handle
- Integration complexity

### 2.4 Alternative Approaches

List 2-3 viable implementation approaches with tradeoffs:

- Approach A: [description] — Pros/Cons
- Approach B: [description] — Pros/Cons
- Recommended approach with justification

## Phase 3: Output (TEXT ONLY - NO FILES)

Present your analysis in this conversation. Do not create any files.

**Option 1: Manual** - Say "implement" or "go ahead" and I will begin.

**Option 2: Autonomous (Ralph Loop)** - Copy and run this command:
```

/ralph-loop "[IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT]" --completion-promise "COMPLETE" --max-iterations [ITERATIONS]

```

```

## Phase 4: Generate Ralph Loop Command

After completing the analysis, generate a ready-to-use `/ralph-loop` command.

**Create the IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT by:**

1. Summarizing the task in 1-2 sentences
2. Listing the key implementation steps from your plan
3. Specifying verification steps (typecheck, lint, test)
4. Including the completion signal

**Set ITERATIONS based on complexity:**

- Low complexity: 10-15 iterations
- Medium complexity: 20-30 iterations
- High complexity: 40-50 iterations

**Output format:**

```
### 🤖 Ralph Loop Command

\`\`\`
/ralph-loop "Implement: [task summary]

1. [step 1]
2. [step 2]
3. [step 3]
...

Verification:
- Run npm run typecheck
- Run npm run lint
- Run npm run test (if applicable)
- Manually verify the feature works

When all steps complete and verification passes, output: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

If stuck after 10+ attempts, output: <promise>BLOCKED</promise> with explanation." --completion-promise "COMPLETE" --max-iterations [N]
\`\`\`

## ⛔ FINAL REMINDER

This analysis is complete when you have:

1. OUTPUT TEXT describing the plan
2. Generated a ready-to-use `/ralph-loop` command

**DO NOT:**

- Create a plan file
- Create any implementation files
- Make any code changes
- "Get started" on implementation
- Fix any issues you discovered

**STOP HERE. Wait for user approval before any implementation.**
